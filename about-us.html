                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>Founders George Clark and Marty Carpenter met while playing in an earlier USAH Nationals Tournament and decided to look into the possibility of putting together a team of older players from North Carolina & South Carolina to compete in various ice hockey tournaments. With help from USA Hockey, they contacted a number of 65+ players to build interest in establishing a team. The result was the formation of the Carolina Classics Hockey Club with 22 charter members. They registered with the IRS and opened a checking account. They also found two sponsors, collected $$ from players, designed a logo, ordered jerseys and socks, and started to set up ice times and locations for practice games. They achieved their initial goal of putting a CCHC team on the ice for the USAH Nationals in April of 2012. The team had a spotless record (didn’t win a damn game!) but enjoyed every minute, especially the beer, camaraderie and long term friendships!!</p>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The members of the CCHC would like to grow this concept into a larger group of players from age 60 to 70+ here in the Carolinas in order to increase the number of opportunities to play in tournaments over a larger age group as well as providing continuity. This will also give CCHC a larger pool of players to facilitate better use of practice ice and grow the “team” aspect among all players of all ages and levels. CCHC will also get into a wider number of great hockey rinks in the process. There are many tournaments up and down the east coast that have divisions for 60+, 65+, and 70+ players. With enough participation, CCHC could have more local games as well.</p>
                    <h3>Vision</h3>
                    <p>CCHC would like to consider the opportunity to register as a non-profit organization to improve the chances of getting sponsors, and hosting a tournament of our own, while supporting a worthwhile charity such as a sled (or sledge) hockey team. Supporting a charity is essential towards becoming a 501 (c) 3 non-profit. Without becoming a non-profit, the costs of sponsoring our own tournament would be overwhelming and prohibitive.</p>
                    <p>As an alternative, CCHC still needs to incorporate with such things as Articles of Incorporation, by-laws and a group of Directors to determine the future of the Club and protect the investment of our members. There are a number of regional hockey clubs that have done this and CCHC will attempt to play in some of their tournaments. CCHC would also like them to come to OURS!</p>

                                    <h3>Costs</h3>
                                    <p>Initial membership registration is $75. Annual dues will be $25 thereafter. All costs to CCHC for ice rental, referee and timekeeper will be shared equally by the participants for each event (i.e.: practices, mini tournaments and games) in our local area. Players will be furnished a home and away jersey and socks for all tournaments, which will remain the property of CCHC. Transportation, lodging, and food costs will be the players’ responsibility at tournaments. CCHC will negotiate preferential rates where possible. Many players will offer to share rides to distant events. All checks and payments will be made payable to Carolina Classics Hockey Club. E-mail is our usual method of communication.</p>
